# Objective :
- The Gender and Age Detection project is a computer vision application that utilizes deep learning techniques to predict the gender and approximate age of individuals based on their facial images. This project can be employed in various domains such as demographic analysis, targeted marketing, or personalized content recommendations.

# Dataset :
For this python project, I had used the Adience dataset; the dataset is available in the public domain and you can find it [here](/kaggle/input/utkface-new). This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. The images have been collected from Flickr albums and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges (as mentioned above) and is about 1GB in size. The models I used had been trained on this dataset.

# Features
- Data Collection: A dataset of facial images with corresponding gender and age labels was gathered for training the models.
- Data Preprocessing: Images were preprocessed to enhance quality and ensure suitability for training deep learning models.
- Model Building: Deep learning models were developed to predict gender and age from facial images.
- Training: The models were trained using the prepared dataset to learn patterns in gender and age recognition.
- Evaluation: Model accuracy and performance were assessed to validate their effectiveness.
- Inference: Trained models are used to predict gender and age of new facial images.
- Visualization: Results and demographic distributions are visualized to provide insights into predictions.
